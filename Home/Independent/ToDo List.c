/*
Taken up a challenge from the challenge project list sent in the BetterC Discord server
How I want it done:
    1. Read todo.txt
    2. Display whatever's there
    3. Each addition is responsive to others, aka. 
    4. Option to add/delete a specific task

I'm having difficulties writing out my wishes.

The terminal method is flawed.
Too many steps to get something done. I disapprove.
Learning a GUI libary it is. I just wish I could make one myself :P
